While GCME the company is new, we (the people at GCME) have been at this for a long time.  And we do it very well. Together we have over 20 years' experience helping people understand their complex telecom invoices, contracts, service records and tariffs.  This means we can really focus on you and will work even harder to ensure you are completely satisfied with us.

Our experiences working from inside a major telecom giant, combined with working with and for customers like you, enable us to zero in on savings. We know exactly what to look for.  Because we speak the carriers' language fluently we can cut through the time-consuming tasks quickly and effectively.  

We are not sales people and do not represent any carriers, CLECs, resellers or anyone else. We represent you, the customer, and only you. We are not pitching new equipment, or new providers or contracts, as nothing about your service will change.

We offer plenty of options and flexibility and will work with you to find a solution that satisfies your business needs.
