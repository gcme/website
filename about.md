title: About Us
---

While GCME the company is new, we at GCME are by no means new to what we do, and we do it very well.  We have over 20 years experience helping people understand their very complex telecom carrier invoices, contracts and service records.  Which means we can really focus on you and will work even harder to ensure you are completely happy with us.

If you would like to know more about our experience, we can tell you that we’ve worked in many functions for a major telecom carrier, so we know exactly what to look for.  No guessing games for us, and no interpretation needed, because we speak Carrier-ese fluently.

We are not sales people and do not represent any carriers, CLECs, resellers or anyone else.  We represent you, the customer, and only you.  You do not have to be concerned we are pitching new equipment or contracts, as nothing about your service will change.

We offer plenty of options and flexibility, so if you have commitment issues, we understand and will work with you to find a solution that satisfies your business’ needs.

But you may save some big money.  And that is our entire focus, saving you money.
