title: About Us
---

While GCME the company is new, we (the people at GCME) have been at this for a long time.  And we do it very well. Together we have over 20 years’ experience helping people understand their very complex telecom invoices, contracts, service records and tariffs.  This means we can really focus on you and will work even harder to ensure you are completely happy with us.

Our experiences working in many functions for a major telecom carrier helps us know exactly what to look for. No guessing games for us, and no interpretation needed, because we speak the carriers’ language fluently.  This is complemented by our time working directly with end-users to update their inventory and reign in their costs.  It provides a unique perspective that focuses our vision to a greater detail enabling us to spot savings quickly and recoup your savings that much faster.

We are not sales people and do not represent any carriers, CLECs, resellers or anyone else. We represent you, the customer, and only you. We are not pitching new equipment, or new providers or contracts, as nothing about your service will change.

We offer plenty of options and flexibility and will work with you to find a solution that satisfies your business’ needs.
