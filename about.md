While GCME the company is new, *we* (the people at GCME) have been at this for a long time. And we do it very well. Together we have *over 20 years' experience* helping people understand their complex telecom invoices, contracts, service records and tariffs.  We focus on your specific needs and will work hard to ensure you get every dollar owed to you.

Our experience working from "inside" a major telecom carrier and "outside" for customers like you, provides us a unique perspective, enabling us to zero in on savings. We know exactly what to look for and are very thorough in our process. Because we speak the carriers' language fluently, we can cut through the time-consuming tasks quickly and effectively.

We are not sales people and do not represent any carriers, CLECs, software companies, resellers or anyone else. We represent you, the customer, and only you.  We offer several options and will work with you to find a solution that satisfies your business needs.

Call today to set up a free review of your telecom services - just to take a look and see if things are going well. There is **no risk** to you and, if we are unable to find any savings for your company, there is **no cost** to you. 

Simply put, we find money owed to you, and help you get it back!
