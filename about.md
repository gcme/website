title: About Us
---

With over 20 combined years' experience in telecom, the dedicated team at GCME is commited to helping businesses understand their complex telecom invoices.  With our specialized knowledge and experience, we know how to decode telecom invoices and translate service records.

Our experience working from "inside" a major telecom carrier and "outside" for customers like you, affords us a truly unique perspective, enabling us to zero in on savings others may miss. We know exactly what to look for and are very thorough in our process. Because we speak the carriers' language fluently, we can cut through these tedious, time-consuming tasks quickly and effectively.

We are not sales people and do not represent any carriers, CLECs, software companies, resellers or anyone else. We represent you, the customer, and only you.  We offer several options and will work with you to find a solution that satisfies your business needs.

Call today to set up a free review of your telecom services - just to take a look and see if things are going well. There is **no risk** to you and, if we are unable to find any savings for your company, there is **no cost** to you. 

Simply put, we find money owed to you, and help you get it back!
