1. Why does my company need this service?
        - Being an ever-changing industry, telecom invoices become more difficult to navigate for many companies.  Add in variables such as multiple carriers, carrier lingo, lengthy contracts with indecipherable language, and it is often more than the best AP department can manage without spending all their time on only telecom invoices.  Because these invoices and services are so complex, it is very easy, and not uncommon, to miss critical savings opportunites.
2. We've seen ads for telecom auditors before.  Why is your company different?
3. How do I know you can save us money?  Can we see your recommendations before committing?
4. How much will this cost our company?
5. Our AP and IT departments are very busy and don't have time to be bothered with this.
6. Can you guarantee savings?
7. How long will it take to complete the audit?
8. We don't want to change our services or carrier, or have any interruption in service.
9. We are using a TEM software  already.  Why do we need this in addition?
10. We are already working with a telecom expense company.   Why would I want to utilize two services?
11. Can my current staff do this?
