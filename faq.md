1. *Why does my company need this service?*  
       Being an ever-changing industry with multiple fragmented regional carriers, telecom invoices have become more difficult to navigate.  Add in variables such as multiple carriers, odd carrier terminology and lengthy contracts with indecipherable language, and soon it seems overwhelming.  We provide a thorough review of your services and costs, informing you of any discrepancies or overbilling. 

2. *Why is your company different?*  
       There are two main distinctions between GCME and other TEM companies.  First, we aren't trying to upsell anything.  We offer an independent, objective review of your teleocm expenses, regardless of your carrier or TEM processing system.  Many other companies are trying to upsell their own software or ongoing management services, which typically require very expensive, long-term contracts.  Second, we have the actual LEC experience so we look for what the others don't see.  Invoices, contracts, CSRs, USOCs, FIDs, tariffs - telecom is our second language.

3. *We have a dedicated team with our carrier.  Aren't they already reviewing our services on a regular basis?*     
       Carriers are not reviewing your bills and services on a regular basis, and they are not auditing your services at all.  Around contract-renewal time you may get an inventory with recommendations to upgrade or amend your contract, but this tends to be more sales-oriented.

4. *Do you guarantee you can save us money?*  
       If we do not find you savings, this means two very good things:  First, your billing is correct and you have maximized your services.  Second, you don't owe us a dime.  We don't charge you if we don't find savings.

5. *Our AP and IT departments are busy and don't have time to be bothered with this.*  
       Your people already have a full plate, we will not add to their workload.  The only thing we may need would be some general information in order to ensure your services' relevance.  

6. *How long does an audit take?*  
       This depends on several variables, such as the volume and complexity of your services, as well as the length and complexity of your contracts.

7. *We don't want to change our services or carrier.*  
       We do not work for any carriers, so we will only audit the servics you already have and pay for.  Nothing changes for your service or carrier; you just pay less for it.

8. *We are using a TEM software system already.*  
       TEM systems can sometimes miss critical billing errors, and some are higher-maintenance which require heavy input to enable them to catch any errors.  A no-cost, no-risk audit can help you determine if you are indeed receiving all the promised benefits from your TEM software system.

9. *We are already working with a telecom expense company.*  
       A second opinion - at no cost and with no risk - is always a good idea.  Any reputable company would welcome having their services validated, and would prefer to know if there are gaps they could improve upon.
