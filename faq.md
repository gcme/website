1. *Why does my company need this service?*  
       Being an ever-changing industry with multiple fragmented regional carriers, telecom invoices become more difficult to navigate for many companies.  Add in variables such as multiple carriers, odd carrier terminology and lengthy contracts with indecipherable language, and soon anyone can be overwhelmed.  We can take a quick, no-cost peek at your services and let you know if the billing is spot-on.

2. *Why is your company different?*  
       Having worked for a major ILEC, we have extensive experience working "on the inside".  We know the navigation required and the language they're speaking, and we also know exactly where most of the billing errors take place.

3. *We have a dedicated team with our carrier.  Aren't they already reviewing our services on a regular basis?*     
       Carriers are not reviewing your bills and services on a regular basis, and they are not auditing your services at all.  Around contract-renewal time you may get an inventory with recommendations to upgrade or amend your contract, but this tends to be more sales-oriented.

4. *Do you guarantee you can save us money?*  
       If we do not find you savings, this means two very good things:  First, your billing is correct and you have maximized your services.  Second, you don't owe us a dime.  We don't charge you if we don't find savings.

5. *Our AP and IT departments are busy and don't have time to be bothered with this.*  
       We will be doing all the work, so the only thing we may need would be some very minimal data in order to find the most money we can for your company.

6. *How long does an audit take?*  
       This depends on several variables, such as the volume and complexity of your services, as well as the length and complexity of your contracts.

7. *We don't want to change our services or carrier.*  
       We do not work for any carriers, so we will only audit the servics you already have and pay for.  Nothing changes for your service or carrier; you just pay less for it.

8. *We are using a TEM software system already.*  
       TEM systems can sometimes miss critical billing errors, and some are higher-maintenance which require heavy input to enable them to catch any errors.  A no-cost, no-risk audit can help you determine if you are indeed receiving all the promised benefits of your system.

9. *We are already working with a telecom expense company.*  
       Chances are that your TEM company is providing excellent service and mazimizing your savings potential.  But a second opinion - at no cost and with no risk - is always a good idea.
