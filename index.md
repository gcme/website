This is where we insist you absolutely, definitely and most certainly need our help in recovering missing or lost money you didn’t know you had.  The fact is, however, that you just might not need them, and perhaps all is indeed well with your telecom billing.  This is really good news, and if it is the case, we are very, very glad for you.  

It is our experience, however, that nearly all businesses using complex telecom services can benefit from a no-cost review of their services.  Your business is a very busy place, and the folks who work there have lots to do besides auditing their telecom contracts, invoices, tariffs, service records and ordering history, let alone the hours spent on calls with carriers.  It’s a lot of very detailed and time-consuming work that can take away from the productivity of your business.

We are offering a free review of your telecom services, just to take a look and see if things are going well.  There is no risk to you and no cost if we can’t find any savings for your company.  We are not selling any telecom services, or contracts, and are impartial as to which carrier you have.  If we find any billing or contract issues, we will let you know, and help you to recover your money.

Simply put, we find money for you, and help you get it back.

Some options we are offering are below, and we can customize any services for your specific needs.

• in-depth one-time audit of all your telecom services, including invoices, inventory, contracts and service records
•	annual audits/service review, or more often, if you’d like
•	inventory updating and maintenance 
•	contract and tariff verification
•	working with your staff to learn what to look for and perform in-house mini-audits
•	escalation assistance for those "tough to solve" issues - we will babysit the issue with the carriers so your staff can do what they do best - their own jobs
•	credit/refund assistance - if you have existing outstanding credits or refunds that you can't seem to get back
•	many, many more services

We offer several options for many services described above, and will work with you to determine the best option for your company.  Consider us your customizable full-time customer advocates.
