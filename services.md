It has been our experience that nearly all businesses using complex telecom services can benefit from a no-cost review of their services. Your people have plenty to do besides auditing their telecom contracts, invoices, service records and ordering history, let alone the hours spent on calls with carriers. The level of detailed and time-consuming effort required can take away from the productivity of your business.

We can customize our services to meet your specific needs.  Consider us your flexible, dedicated advocates.

* in-depth one-time audit of all your telecom services, including invoices, inventory, contracts and service records

* annual audits/service review, or more often, if you'd like

* inventory updating and maintenance

* contract and tariff verification

* working with your staff to learn what to look for and perform in-house mini-audits

* escalation assistance for those tough-to-solve issues.  We will babysit the issue with the carriers so your staff can do what they do best - their own jobs

* credit/refund assistance - if you have existing outstanding credits or refunds that you cannot seem to get back

* many more services!  Contact us for a free, no-risk consultation!
